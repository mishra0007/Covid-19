# Covid-19-FAQ

 I have completed my first #androidproject named COVID. 
 So here I have used #restApi to get latest news article related to COVID-19 and also to get world data on COVID cases.
 I have used the #Firebase authentication system to sign in and sign up.
 And to gather data from the user I have used #google Realtime database system.
 I have also used some well know the open-source dependencies to create a clean and smooth UI.
 Mostly I have used #JAVA, #JSON, #xml and a little bit of #kotlin for my project.
 I also want to thanks ARSL Tech youtube channel for teaching me some good pieces of stuff which I used in my #project.
 Lots more on the way #bePositive. 
 
 And feel free to contribute to my project
